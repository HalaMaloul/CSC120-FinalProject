 - A map of your game's layout (if applicable)
 - `cheatsheet.md`
 - Completed `rubric.md`
  
## Additional Reflection Questions
 - What was your **overall approach** to tackling this project?
 we focused on having simple methods and then we built on them to have the loop and to allow multiple paths in the game. We also focused on the storyline as we wanted it to be intertaining and engaging. We also worked on having a strong base for our game for example having the different battles with different conditions. 
 - What **new thing(s)** did you learn / figure out in completing this project?
 We learned that we have to plan before starting to code. We learned how to use while loops for our advantages by switching different variables between true and false.
 - Is there anything that you wish you had **implemented differently**?
 - If you had **unlimited time**, what additional features would you implement?
 - What was the most helpful **piece of feedback** you received while working on your project? Who gave it to you?
 - If you could go back in time and give your past self some **advice** about this project, what hints would you give?
 - _If you worked with a team:_ please comment on how your **team dynamics** influenced your experience working on this project.
